# Gaussian Mixture Models

This repository is the result of a Semester Project on Gaussian Mixture Models by Goirik Chakrabarty and Purva Parmar, under Prof Leelavati Narlikar at IISER Pune. The site is built using [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/).

Site Link: https://thereconpilot.github.io/gaussian-mixture-models

## Local Development

Install requirements:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

After that, add or edit any content, and assuming that we are in the top level folder where the `_config.yml` file is present, we can build using

```
jb build .
```

Refer to [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/) for more details.

The build files should be present in `_build/html`. This directory should be used to check final results before committing content to git.

The site is automatically built and published with GitHub Actions, so the `_build` directory has been added to `.gitignore`.
